# The issue is most likely coming from the rewrite that you have in your ingress manifest.

#     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

# this means that when the ingress receives the request from the client it takes the path portion of the url and rewrites it to be /, before passing it down to your backend, which in turn results in backend returning the root page of your website.
